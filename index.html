    <p1>This 1970's British rock band is known for their emotional lyrics about love and finding the one. They came at the end of the synth wave and the begging of the punk and alt rock wave so this ends up with them having a very unique sound.</p1>

<p2>This band is also british but they are from the 1980's. There sound is also emotional however they're lyrics are much more self loathing. Their sound somewhat similar to The Smiths but with a more artistic and alternative rock sound.</p2>
