          This 1970's British rock band is known for their emotional lyrics
          about love and finding the one. They came at the end of the synth wave
          and the begging of the punk and alt rock wave so this ends up with
          them having a very unique sound.

          This band is also british but they are from the 1980's. There sound is
          also emotional however they're lyrics are much more self loathing.
          Their sound somewhat similar to The Smiths but with a more artistic
          and alternative rock sound.
